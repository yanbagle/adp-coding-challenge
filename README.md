# Adp Front End Coding Challenge

Hi there! The app is hosted at https://yanzhang000.github.io/adp-coding-challenge/

Thanks a lot for your time!

List of things I would do to expand this app: 
  Unit test
  Make the films' title clickable to expand and display more info like a mini IMDB
  Add pictures for the characters, but unfortunately the API doesn't provide image URLs 

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
